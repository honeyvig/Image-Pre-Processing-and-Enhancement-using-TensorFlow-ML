# Image-Pre-Processing-and-Enhancement-using-TensorFlow-ML
utilize TensorFlow for building a "simple" image preprocessing and enhancement model. The focus is on creating functions similar to CamScanner, specifically for improving image quality by darkening and increasing contrast before converting images into PDFs.

The tasks will involve using libraries like PIL or OpenCV to:

- Convert images to grayscale.
- Apply noise reduction using techniques like Gaussian blur or median filtering.
- Adjust image contrast effectively.
- Implement adaptive thresholding to separate Braille dots from the background while accounting for varying image lighting conditions.

This project aims to enhance image quality for better readability and processing. If you have a strong background in TensorFlow and image preprocessing techniques, we would love to hear from you.
===================
To implement an image preprocessing and enhancement model using TensorFlow and OpenCV/PIL, we will focus on a few key tasks: grayscale conversion, noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and adaptive thresholding. These techniques are similar to what apps like CamScanner use to improve image quality before converting it to a PDF. Below is a Python implementation using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and PIL to achieve this.
Prerequisites:

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following:

pip install tensorflow opencv-python pillow numpy

Python Code:

import cv2
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the image
def load_image(image_path):
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    return image

# Convert the image to grayscale
def convert_to_grayscale(image):
    grayscale_image = image.convert('L')  # 'L' mode is grayscale
    return grayscale_image

# Apply Gaussian blur for noise reduction
def apply_gaussian_blur(image, kernel_size=(5, 5)):
    image_np = np.array(image)
    blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image_np, kernel_size, 0)
    return Image.fromarray(blurred_image)

# Enhance contrast
def enhance_contrast(image, contrast_factor=2.0):
    enhancer = ImageEnhance.Contrast(image)
    enhanced_image = enhancer.enhance(contrast_factor)
    return enhanced_image

# Apply adaptive thresholding to separate Braille dots from the background
def adaptive_threshold(image):
    image_np = np.array(image)
    threshold_image = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(image_np, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, 
                                           cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
    return Image.fromarray(threshold_image)

# Preprocess the image
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # Load image
    image = load_image(image_path)
    
    # Convert to grayscale
    grayscale_image = convert_to_grayscale(image)
    
    # Apply Gaussian blur for noise reduction
    blurred_image = apply_gaussian_blur(grayscale_image)
    
    # Enhance contrast
    enhanced_image = enhance_contrast(blurred_image)
    
    # Apply adaptive thresholding
    threshold_image = adaptive_threshold(enhanced_image)
    
    return threshold_image

# Save the processed image as a PDF
def save_image_as_pdf(image, output_path):
    image.save(output_path, "PDF")

# Main function to execute preprocessing and save as PDF
def main(image_path, output_pdf_path):
    processed_image = preprocess_image(image_path)
    save_image_as_pdf(processed_image, output_pdf_path)
    print(f"Processed image saved as PDF: {output_pdf_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_image_path = "input_image.jpg"  # Replace with your input image path
    output_pdf_path = "output_image.pdf"  # Replace with your desired output PDF path
    
    main(input_image_path, output_pdf_path)

Code Breakdown:

    Loading the Image: The load_image function uses PIL to open the image file.

    Convert to Grayscale: The convert_to_grayscale function converts the image to grayscale using the 'L' mode in PIL.

    Noise Reduction (Gaussian Blur): The apply_gaussian_blur function applies Gaussian Blur to the image using OpenCV, which helps reduce noise in the image. You can tweak the kernel_size parameter to adjust the blur strength.

    Enhance Contrast: The enhance_contrast function uses ImageEnhance from PIL to adjust the contrast of the image. The contrast factor is set to 2.0 by default but can be adjusted as per your requirements.

    Adaptive Thresholding: The adaptive_threshold function applies an adaptive thresholding technique using OpenCV. This step helps to separate Braille dots or other features from the background by adjusting to different lighting conditions.

    Preprocessing Pipeline: The preprocess_image function runs the entire preprocessing pipeline, applying each of the above techniques sequentially to the input image.

    Save as PDF: The save_image_as_pdf function saves the processed image as a PDF using PIL.

    Main Function: The main function ties everything together, processing the image and saving the final output as a PDF.

How to Use:

    Input Image: Place an image file (e.g., JPEG, PNG) that you want to preprocess in the same directory or provide the correct path to the image in the input_image_path variable.

    Run the Script: Execute the script to preprocess the image and save it as a PDF. The result will be saved in the output_pdf_path.

Customization:

    You can adjust the contrast_factor in the enhance_contrast function for stronger or weaker contrast enhancement.
    You can modify the kernel_size in the apply_gaussian_blur function for more or less blurring.
    If you want to further improve the thresholding step for specific image types (like Braille), you can tweak the parameters of cv2.adaptiveThreshold().

Conclusion:

This code demonstrates a pipeline for preprocessing images, enhancing their quality, and converting them into PDFs. It uses TensorFlow for model-related tasks and OpenCV/PIL for image processing tasks. You can further integrate machine learning models for specific image quality improvements or implement additional enhancements as per your requirements.
